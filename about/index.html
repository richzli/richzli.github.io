                    I came in with high hopes for my third and final World Finals. Our team had trained hard for this moment, and we knew we were strong. Unfortunately, our expectations weren't met, and in the end, the elusive medal would be forever out of reach.

                    <br>

                    With the closing of the 2024 World Finals also came the closing of my competitive programming career. Despite the bittersweet ending, I know I'll look back at my journey fondly: the knowledge I gained, the friends I made, and the places I went are all unforgettable. There's no time to regret—the only thing one can do is to take those learnings and apply them to future endeavors.

                    My thesis was (very broadly) about improving on some existing graph algorithms—more details can be found in the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> section. There's a lot of stories I can tell here, but I want to condense my journey into three main takeaways. First, take your time. Nothing sound ever comes out of rushed work, and I progressed much faster when I started meticulously writing proofs out. Second, don't be afraid to ask for help. Having weekly discussions with my advisor let me come up with important insights even when I thought I didn't need it. And finally, a little bit of faith can go a long way. You'll make it in the end, even if the road ahead is unclear.

                    I'm most in my element when it comes to anything algorithms, so when I got the chance to TA for our graduate algorithms course, I jumped at the opportunity. We only had two TAs this semester for a class size of around seventy students, so I took initiative and handled much of the student-to-staff communication, test administration, and overall course organization. My advisor, Kent, is one of the best lecturers I've had the chance to work with, and my own communication skills improved in leaps and bounds this semester.

                    CS 180 is the first course that incoming computer science students take at Purdue, so I felt a peculiar responsibility fall on me when I accepted this role. The structured curriculum and fast pace made it hard for me to influence the content at a high level, but I made it my top priority to be a great role model wherever I could. I helped explore students' interests further in my lab sessions, and tried drilling in the fundamentals during my office hours, rather than focusing on rote memorization. Thinking back to my time as a freshman, having great TA's definitely helped my transition to college, and I did my best to repay the favor, no matter how small the impact might be.

                    I returned to Amazon EKS this summer, developing a crucial testing framework for an authentication webhook.

During my time here, I gained a significant amount of experience in Kubernetes cluster management and internal systems, and in the process became a Kubernetes contributor! I'm grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this huge ecosystem.

It was a wonderful experience, and I'm proud that I was able to participate at the highest level of competition in the field.

At my first ever internship, I excelled in the role, designing, building, and presenting a much-needed developer tool within 11 weeks. I learned quite a bit about AWS and infrastructure-as-code, and became much more comfortable working with a team and collaborating on projects. I'm glad that I was able to make an impact in the short time that I was there.

                    Being on the opposite side of the lecture hall helped me broaden my perspectives. From a semester and a summer of teaching my own class, I learned much about the importance of communicating ideas clearly and being open to new technologies. Afterwards, I continued on in a more managerial role, getting to see just how much work is put into running a class smoothly. I'm proud that I've able to use my skills to guide this course along for multiple years.
